# Usage Quantity

The Usage Quantity represents the volume of a given SKU associated with a [*resource*](#glossary:resource) or [*service*](#glossary:service) used, based on the [Usage Unit](#usageunit). Usage Quantity is often derived at a finer granularity or over a different time interval when compared to the [Pricing Quantity](#pricingquantity) (complementary to [Pricing Unit](#pricingunit)), and focuses on *resource* and *service* consumption, not pricing and cost.

UsageQuantity MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type Decimal and MUST conform to [Numeric Format](#numericformat). The value MAY be negative in cases where [ChargeSubcategory](#chargesubcategory) is "Refund".

This column MUST NOT be null under the following conditions:

* When [ChargeCategory](#chargecategory) is "Usage" and ChargeSubcategory is "On-Demand" or "Used Commitment".
* When ChargeCategory is "Adjustment" and ChargeSubcategory is "Refund", related to charges with a specific SkuPriceId.

This column MUST be null in case of any other ChargeCategory â€“ ChargeSubcategory combinations.
